**Abstract:** 
Internet of Things (IoT) is a fast-growing innovation that will greatly change the way humans live. It can be thought of as the next big step in Internet technology. What really enable IoT to be a possibility are the various technologies that build it up. The IoT architecture mainly requires two types of technologies: data acquisition technologies and networking technologies. Many technologies are currently present that aim to serve as components to the IoT paradigm. This paper aims to categorize the various technologies present that are commonly used by Internet of Things.
