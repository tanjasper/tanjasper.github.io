I do research on the following topics:
- Computational imaging
- Computer vision
- Machine learning (including deep learning)
- Privacy-preserving machine learning

## Deep Learning + Computational Imaging

I have multiple publications exploring how deep learning (DL) can be used for the next generation of imaging systems.

- In [EDoF-ToF](https://opg.optica.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-29-23-38540&id=464511) (2021), I use DL techniques to extend the depth-of-field of a ***time-of-flight camera*** for wider 3D sensing.
- In [CAnOPIC](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9102956) (2020), I use DL to design a ***privacy-preserving camera/sensor*** for machine vision tasks.
- In [Towards Photorealistic Reconstruction of Highly Multiplexed Lensless Images](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/papers/Khan_Towards_Photorealistic_Reconstruction_of_Highly_Multiplexed_Lensless_Images_ICCV_2019_paper.pdf) (2019), we use DL to reconstruct images from thin mask-based (coded aperture) ***lensless cameras***. 
- In [Face Detection and Verification Using Lensless Cameras](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8590781) (2018), I develop a DL-based pipeline for performing face detection and verification with ***lensless cameras***.

## Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning

I have some pre-prints that take steps toward answering a big question in privacy-preserving machine learning: "how do different aspects of a machine learning algorithm/model affect the privacy of its training data?".
I explore this question through the lens of membership inference: the task of identifying whether a data point was in a given machine learning model's training dataset or not.

- In [Parameters or Privacy](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.01243.pdf) (2022), I theoretically and empirically characterize how the privacy of a linear regression model is affected by how overparameterized it is.
- In [Benign Overparameterization in Membership Inference with Early Stopping](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.14055.pdf) (2022), I study how parameters and training epochs affect a classifier's privacy.

## Other Works

I typically have broad interests, and here are some other completed projects around machine learning, signal processing, and computer vision.

- In [MINER](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.03532.pdf) (2022), we develop a very efficient method based on Laplacian pyramids and residual learning for learning implicit ***neural representations***.
- In [Wearing A Mask](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9413450) (2021), we use ***recurrent neural tangent kernels*** for kernel-based dimensionality reduction of variable-length sequences.
- In [Near-Linear-Phase IIR Filters Using Gauss-Newton Optimization](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8885116) (2019), I design ***IIR filters*** with near-linear phase responses using Gauss-Newton optimization techniques.
- In [Flat Focus](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7953403) (2017), I characterize the depth-of-field of a thin mask-based ***lensless imaging*** system.
