I am currently a **computational imaging research engineer** at [Glass Imaging](https://glass-imaging.com).

Previously, I was an Electrical & Computer Engineering PhD student at [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu) doing research on **machine learning** and **computational imaging**. 
More specifically, I worked on (a) integrating deep learning with novel types of imaging devices and (b) analyzing the privacy implications of machine learning algorithms.
I was part of both the [Rice Digital Signal Processing Group](https://dsp.rice.edu) and the [Rice Computational Imaging Group](https://computationalimaging.rice.edu) and was advised by [Prof. Richard G Baraniuk](https://richb.rice.edu) and [Prof. Ashok Veeraraghavan](https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/ashok-veeraraghavan).
