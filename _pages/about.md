*[I am graduating in December 2022 and am open to employment! If you are looking for someone skilled in machine learning, deep learning, and computational imaging, please feel free to contact me via email or linkedin!]*

I am an Electrical & Computer Engineering PhD student at [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu) doing research on **machine learning** and **computational imaging**. 
More specifically, I work on (a) integrating deep learning with novel types of imaging devices and (b) analyzing the privacy implications of machine learning algorithms.


I am part of both the [Rice Digital Signal Processing Group](https://dsp.rice.edu) and the [Rice Computational Imaging Group](https://computationalimaging.rice.edu) and am advised by [Prof. Richard G Baraniuk](https://richb.rice.edu) and [Prof. Ashok Veeraraghavan](https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/ashok-veeraraghavan).
