I am a **computational imaging research engineer** at [Glass Imaging](https://glass-imaging.com) designing AI algorithms for mobile image signal processing. I leverage deep learning techniques to perform image restoration tasks such as demosaicing, denoising, super-resolution, and others.

I obtained my PhD in Electrical & Computer Engineering from [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu) as a KKI Enhancement fellow and D2K fellow, where I researched computational imaging, computer vision, and machine learning (ML). More specifically, I worked on (a) integrating deep learning with novel types of imaging devices and (b) analyzing the privacy implications of machine learning algorithms. My research has been published in venues such as IEEE Transactions on Comptuational Imaging, Optica Optics Express, NeurIPS, AISTATS, and others. I was part of both the [Rice Digital Signal Processing Group](https://dsp.rice.edu) and the [Rice Computational Imaging Group](https://computationalimaging.rice.edu) and was advised by [Prof. Richard G Baraniuk](https://richb.rice.edu) and [Prof. Ashok Veeraraghavan](https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/ashok-veeraraghavan).
